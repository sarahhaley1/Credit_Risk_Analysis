## Overview of Credit Risk Analysis

### Backgound 
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Using the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries building and evaluating models using resmapling methods will help determine the best possible analysis method to reduce the risk of loss on loan returns. 

### Purpose 
The Purpose of this anlaysis is to use the resampling models to predict credit risk with imbalanced learn and scikit-learn libraries and evaluating which method provides the prediction with the least error. Combining and comapring methods are different ways of ensuring the best model is provided at the end. Finding the best predictor for the credit risk with the least error is the main purpose of this analaysis.

## Results

#### Using Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
- Naive Random Oversampling
    - The balanced accuracy score for naive oversampling does not prove to be accurate with a balanced accuracy score of about 64%. This 64% accuracy score proves to be insuffcient because it means that this model accurately predicts the Credit Risk only 64% of the time. For the credit company this could potentially lead to many losses with inaccurate predictions, thus this is not a desired method.

- SMOTE Oversampling
  - The balanced accuracy score for SMOTE oversampling method does not prove to be accurate either with a score of about 65%, with a similar explanation as above.

- Undersampling
  - The balanced accuracy score for undersampling proved the method to also not be accurate with the score of about 54.74%.

- Combination - over and under sampling
  - The balanced accuracy score for combination sampling proved the method to be another inaccurate representation with an accuracy score of about 64.29%

### Using Endemble Learners to determine best performance
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier
    - The balanced accuracy score for Balanced Random Forest proves to be more accurate than the other methods however, it still proves to be not quite accurate enough with an accuracy score of about 78.78%. The higher rate of this BRF model still could lead to many potential losses due to its lack of reliability.

- Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
    - The balanced accuracy score for Easy Ensemble AdaBoost proves to be the most accurate model teste in this analaysis. This model will accurately predict the credit risk about 92.5% of the time. This is highly accurate and thus could be an acceptable method of predictige analysis.

## Summary

Through the resampling and esemble methods, when analyzing the different balanced accuracy scores, the conclusion that can be drawn is that none of the tested methods in this analysis are accurate enough to use in predicting credit risk. The reason for these methods not being accurate enough is typically, when using models there is the hope for their outputs to accurately represent the true data. Within these different model trials when comparing their outputs with their true values there is a low accuracy rate for many of them. This means that the predictive model is risky to use because if it is not accurately predicting then there is a higher potential for losses to occur. 
Further analysis can to be conducted in order to find a prediction model that will work with predicting credit risk in order to reduce losses from the found accurate model of 92% with the easy ensemble method. However, this is a highly accurate model and should suffice.
